### Purpose
These notes provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of key material covered in the first-year PhD microeconomics sequence at UCSC. Notes are adapted
from both lectures held at UCSC during the 2024-25 term, and include all topics covered in the first year microeconomics sequence. They include theorems, definitions, proofs, explanations, examples, and problem sets to aid understanding and application.
